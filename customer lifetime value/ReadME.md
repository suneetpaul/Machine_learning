# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction 🎯

This project aims to **predict the Lifetime Value of customers** using historical interaction and profile data, helping businesses make informed decisions on marketing, retention, and revenue optimization.

## 📌 Objective

Predict the **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** using regression techniques such as Linear Regression and Random Forest, based on customer attributes and behavior.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas 📊  
- Scikit-learn 🤖  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📈  

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains details like:
- Customer demographics (Gender, Education, etc.)
- Policy & Claim details (Monthly Premium, Claim Amount, etc.)
- Coverage and service data

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning** 🧹  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍  
3. **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing** ⚙️  
4. **Model Building**  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - R² Score  
   - RMSE & MAE  
6. **Visualization of Results**

## 📈 Results

- **Linear Regression**: R² ≈ 0.49  
- **Random Forest**: R² ≈ 0.88 ✅

The Random Forest model performed best, showing high prediction accuracy.
