# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project applies multiple machine learning models to predict the onset of diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. 
The objective is to compare different classifiers and understand their performance in a real-world medical prediction scenario.

## 📁 Dataset

* **Source**: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
* **Features**: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age
* **Target**: Binary outcome (1 = diabetic, 0 = non-diabetic) - class

## 🧪 Models Used

* **Logistic Regression**
* **Naive Bayes**
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** with k=5

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.

### Visualizations:

* Histograms for Glucose, BMI, and Age
* Correlation heatmap for feature relationships
* Class balance plot
* Confusion matrix heatmaps for each model

## 📊 Model Performance Summary

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.80     | 0.80      | 0.80   | 0.80     |
| Naive Bayes         | 0.80     | 0.80      | 0.80   | 0.80     |
| KNN (k=5)           | 0.70     | 0.71      | 0.70   | 0.70     |


## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes performed equally well in this dataset.
* KNN lagged slightly due to sensitivity to feature scaling and noise.
* Evaluation via confusion matrices highlighted differences in prediction quality.
