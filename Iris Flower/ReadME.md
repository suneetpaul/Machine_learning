# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on classifying the species of the Iris flower using various supervised machine learning algorithms. The classic **Iris dataset** is used, and multiple models are evaluated and compared for performance.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the dataset using visualizations and statistical summaries.
- **Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode labels, and standardize features.
- **Modeling:** Train and test multiple classification models.
- **Evaluation:** Use confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report.
- **Visualization:** Compare model performance with graphs.
